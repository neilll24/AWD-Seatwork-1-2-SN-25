## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
Description of the project in details.

Guiding Question:
- What is the project
  The project is a Car Rental System website designed to help users rent cars online. It provides an easy-to-navigate interface for customers to view available cars, get detailed information about each car,   and make rental requests. It also includes additional pages like About Us, Contact, and Home with a hero section to engage users.
- Whats the purpose
  The purpose of the Car Rental System is to:

    Facilitate car rentals online by displaying available cars for users.
    Allow users to view car details, including pricing, specifications, and availability.
    Provide contact information and an About Us page to establish trust and provide transparency.
    Create an attractive, user-friendly, and modern interface that makes booking a car seamless.
  
- What are key components
- 
    Home Page (Hero Section): A welcoming page that introduces the service and encourages users to browse the available cars or book a car rental.
    Car Listing Page: Displays available cars with detailed information, such as images, pricing, and a brief description of each car.
    Contact Page: Provides essential contact information for customer inquiries or support.
    About Us Page: Gives a brief overview of the company, its mission, and the services it offers.
    Footer: A persistent footer across pages with links to the About Us and Contact pages and additional information.
  
- What technology used and how it is used
  HTML (HyperText Markup Language):

    Used for structuring the content of the website, creating sections such as the header, footer, main content, and pages like Home, Cars, Contact, and About Us.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
    Used for styling the website, including layout, fonts, colors, animations, and hover effects.
    CSS Grid and Flexbox are used to manage the layout of sections (e.g., the car list and navigation menu).
    Transitions and animations are used to enhance user interaction, such as hover effects on links, buttons, and images.

JavaScript:
    Used to add interactivity to the website.
    For instance, the Car Listing page would dynamically populate the available cars using JavaScript by fetching data and displaying it in a card format.

Google Fonts:
    The Montserrat font is imported for a modern and professional design.

Image assets:
    High-quality images are used for the car listings and hero section to enhance visual appeal.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```

|   |   └─ style.css
